# Code Contests Repository

## Overview
Welcome to the **Code Contests Repository**! ðŸŽ‰ This repository contains solutions to various coding challenges and contests. The goal is to share, improve, and learn from well-crafted solutions to diverse programming problems.

## Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
- **`problem-id/`**: Each folder corresponds to a problem ID (e.g., `1002/`) and contains:
  - **`main.py`**: Python solution to the problem.
  - **`test_cases/`**: Test case files used for debugging.
  - **`README.md`**: Problem statement and description.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/code-contests.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the desired problem folder:
   ```bash
   cd code-contests/<problem-id>/
   ```
3. Run the solution:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
4. Modify or improve the solutions and create a pull request for contributions.

## Problem Details
For each problem, the respective folder includes:
- **Problem Statement**: Description of the challenge.
- **Input and Output Requirements**: Clear guidelines based on the problem description.
- **Solution Code**: Python implementation and explanation of logic.

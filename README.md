# Code Contests Repository

## Overview
Welcome to the **Code Contests Repository**! ðŸŽ‰ This repository contains solutions to various coding challenges and contests. The goal is to share, improve, and learn from well-crafted solutions to diverse programming problems.

## Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
- **`contests/site/`**: Contains directories for different contest sites (e.g., `beecrowd`).
- **`contests/site/`**: Each directory corresponds to a specific contest and contains:
  - C++ solution files (e.g., `BEE_1000.cpp`).

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git@gitlab.com:pessoal1761115/code-contest.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the desired problem folder:
   ```bash
   cd contests/beecrowd/BEE_1000.cpp
   ```
3. Compile and run the solution:
   ```bash
   g++ BEE_1000.cpp
   ./a.out
   ```
4. Modify or improve the solutions and create a pull request for contributions.

## Problem Details
For each problem, the respective folder includes:
- **Problem Statement**: Description of the challenge.
- **Input and Output Requirements**: Clear guidelines based on the problem description.
- **Solution Code**: Python implementation and explanation of logic.

## Dependencies
List any dependencies or tools required to run the solutions here. For example:
- C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
- Any specific libraries or packages

## Contribution Guidelines
- Follow C++ coding standards and best practices.
- Add test cases for the solutions.
- Use meaningful commit messages and follow the branch naming conventions (e.g., `feature/<description>` or `bugfix/<description>`).
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting a pull request.
- Provide a clear explanation in the `README.md` file for each problem.
